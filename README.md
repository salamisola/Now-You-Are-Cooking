# Now-You-Are-Cooking

Now You're Cookin' is a recipe app that strives to create an engaging user experience.  

* Users add recipes with pre-set ratings

* Recipes can be searched by pre-set criteria

* All Recipes can be rated by other users to create greater recipe validation

* Participating in our community rewards users in a variety of ways. Using a point system,users can gain bonus points for adding recipes, rating recipes as well as "point boost" for having their recipe picked as a "Lottery Pick" and "Top Performers". Ultimately, recipes will be put into weekly "Plate Playoffs", a type of bracket contest.

Competition encourages recipe testing which will improve the richness of user-tested recipe database.

## Getting Started

This app requires the MySQL, Express, Handlebars and   npm packages :

   * [Mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)

   * [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)

   * [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars)

   * [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
      

### Deployment
* Clone repo
* Run npm install
* You will need to add a password to connect the Mysql database to run locally



Check it out on Heroku: https://blooming-ocean-27728.herokuapp.com/

### Issues
This project was largely successful due to the Cat App Activty.  It was the starter code for me -- I then adapted to the specific requirements of the Burger app. I did keep the delete fuctionality that was introduced in the cat activity. But, only when a Burger was in the "devoured/Eaten" category.  I would have played with the CSS more, but need to put my energy into our next project.  It was a little tricky moving from file to file to access different sections, but I got the hang of it. I like Handlebars -- although three files for one html page seems complicated.

Uploading to heroku was a hassle, but lucklily I had it set up so I could use this as an example in our class activity. And was able to deploy it with help from Bryan and Buzz.
