# Now-You're-Cookin'

Now You're Cookin' is a recipe app that strives to create an engaging user experience.  

* Users add recipes with pre-set ratings

* Recipes can be searched by pre-set criteria

* All Recipes can be rated by other users to create greater recipe validation

* Participating in our community rewards users in a variety of ways. Using a point system,users can gain bonus points for adding recipes, rating recipes as well as "point boost" for having their recipe picked as a "Lottery Pick" and "Top Performers". Ultimately, recipes will be put into weekly "Plate Playoffs", a type of bracket contest.

Competition encourages recipe testing which will improve the richness of user-tested recipe database.


## Getting Started

   * [seqeulize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)
      

### Deployment

* You will need to add a password to connect the database to run locally

Check it out on Heroku: https://warm-journey-73403.herokuapp.com/

### Issues

Our app uses login verification, users are keep in the database and as the app is built out further it allows for us to track their participation.  We sucessfully tied users and their ratings thus far. We were able to successfully add recipes to a database.  We were also able to conduct searches on a very basic level. The point bonus opportunities were created as well, specifically "Lottery PicK" and "Top Performers".

Unfortuntely, we were not able to successfully present results on the appropriate html pages. We did have success with the Lottery Pick presentation, but it was wiped out in the second to last git push. Additonally, we were able to create a page that rendered the database results --  but we didn't need such a page.

Beyond fully presenting our current app, we think the "Plate Playoffs" would be a unique and compelling offering to "Now You're Cookin'"
